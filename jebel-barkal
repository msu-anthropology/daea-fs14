		  <p>
		 Jebel Barkal is probably one of the most important cities for archaeological and historical research and excavation in Ancient Egyptian territory. Its location, development, and the surrounding area which it is nestled within are all significant in its history of progress and development as well as supporting theories surrounding the time and space growth and progress in Ancient Egypt. It is significant primarily for religious purposes but it was located near an ancient city Napata which was located in the region called Nubia at the time. The landscape is heavily sculpted with temples, pyramids, burial mounds, funeral piers, and palaces making this site as exquisite and luxurious as possible . At the time, it was surely one of the most beautiful and elite cities in all of Egypt.

		  Jebel Barkal is located at approximately 18 degrees north and 31 degrees east in Upper Egypt east of the Nile. Jebel Barkal itself is composed of several sites in one- It is a very small mountain located some 400 km north of Khartoum , in Karima located in the northern state of Sudan. It is commonly a very hot and arid region with seasons between drought and some excessive flooding, but overall, the landscape is wondrous to behold. It also includes Karnak, one of the most significant and important religious destinations in all over Upper Egypt which to this day remains a pillar of faith for Ancient Egyptian history. Napata is the town that eventually expanded out of the religious flux. Not only was it an important city for politics and religion, but trade was heavy here as well and ships coming in and out through the Nile enable easy transportation of people and goods.

		    Description of the Site
		  </title>
		</h1>
		  <p>
		 When the Egyptians conquered northern Sudan which was known as  Kush or Upper Nubia in the early Eighteenth Dynasty (somewhere around 1504 BCE), they identified Jebel Barkal as the birthplace and chief southern residence of their state god Amun-Re, a chief God for the Ancient Egyptians. As part of their program of conquest, they established the cult of Amun-Re in many places in Nubia, but Jebel Barkal appears to have had a unique importance for them as a creation site and home of a primeval aspect of Amun-Re who renewed life each year with the Nile inundation bringing water necessary for life in the area and crops for harvest and trade. Just beneath Jebel Barkal, a major religious organization was set up called Karnak, one of the most well-known sites in Egypt today, its luxurious temples are the prime attraction. This heavily devotional site was approximately 1250 km upstream from Thebes, a once ancient capital city. The settlement which grew up around Karnak was called Napata and it soon became a busy city and a wealthy one mostly due to politics. Jebel Barkal's most distinctive feature is the colossal free-standing pinnacle on the south corner of its cliff . This towering monolith, unparalleled in the Nile Valley, was anciently perceived as a gigantic natural statue with many overlapping identities: a rearing uraeus serpent, a phallus, a squatting god (or several), and, depending on the direction from which it was seen, a vague human form crowned with a sun disk or a White Crown – or perhaps even a Red Crown or Double Crown which were all common for Upper Egyptian pharaohs to wear. Numerous pyramids and temples as well as palaces were uncovered here and the history of conquest and political chaos in this city resulted in its demise sometime around the 4th century CE before it was exclusively a burial site and then forgotten about entirely.

		  Numerous additions to the temple were made by future Pharaohs from the Late and Roman periods. The temple surely played an important role to the royal household and family claims that Seti decedents had on the throne. Ramses I, Seti’s father, and Seti himself was a warrior and had no royal blood. Without this claim, he built temples and proved himself through his architectural works and diplomacy that he was worthy of the title Pharaoh, much like his father had. However, Seti I is considered by the Egyptians to have been a legitimate king and ruler. Because seventy-six legitimate kings are listed in the tomb as pharaohs of Egypt, they are seen as the true rulers. Incidentally, those who were not seen as rulers of Egypt were Hatshepsut and Akhenaten. This helped Seti and his descendants with their claim to the throne.

		 Early explorers and excavators are plentiful and primarily are clustered within the 19th century.  George Waddington and Bernard Hanbury were excavating in 1820 and by the following year, five other archaeologists had met at the spot to excavate. Until 1973 no further excavations had taken place beyond the 1916-1920 excavation handled by George Reisner. In 1973, Prof. F. Sergio Donadoni of the University of Rome reopened the site. Up to that point the urban remains of Napata had not yet been identified, but the rolling rubble heaps extending southeast from the front of the sanctuary to the line of palms bordering the riverbank suggested the area of major ancient settlement.  While Reisner had concentrated his efforts exclusively in the area of the visible temples (from B 500 southwest to B 200), Donadoni began exploring the presumed area of the settlement.  In 1977 he discovered two previously unknown Meroitic temples (the Meroitic Period lasting from 1300-1400) and Meroitic house remains about 800 m southeast of the mountain near the edge of the palm line.  He next discovered the remains of an enormous square palace (B 1500), belonging to the joint Meroitic rulers Natakamani and Amanitore (first century CE).

		  At the end of their work, a new addition of archaeologists were brought in called the  National Corp. for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM). They are still working at the site to this day. More palaces, temples, and artifacts in general had been uncovered and researched since then and today possibly the most interesting ruin is that of the Great Temple of Amun-Re. Unusually, it is built along two axis running both east-west and north-south. Construction took place over several reigns of different kings and the huge entrance pylon is actually unfinished, as attested by the unequal height of its upper regions, the uncut clocks which project from its un-decorated surfaces and the remains of the mud-brick construction ramp that is still present on its interior side.  It is one of the most visited sites in Karnak, a heavily religious and important site in Jebel Barkal. Despite the fact that it has been excavated for so long, the site was only recently, in 2003, named a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO organization.

		 In this temple there are six pylons built by various kings such as Ramses II and Tuthmosis III and inscriptions of the wall are all religious- depictions of Amun-Re and other Gods. Worshiping, offering, and various exchanging of gifts are displayed on the walls of the temple and the outside beholds statues, obelisks of Hatsheput and other works of architectural genius. Overall, the site is filled with pyramids dedicated to various kings which contributed to the project of constructing the site and its components. The palaces there are unique and largely in ruins today but despite this, they displayed an obvious political importance to the region and the amount of religious and structural icons here dedicated to all the most revered and even the most scandalous kings and queens of Egypt are what makes this site so incredibly unique and a collective gold mine for egyptologists and archaeologists.

		     Conclusion – importance of site & excavations, how it fits into overall Egyptian archaeology (and related to other similar sites), etc.

      <p>
     The site is particularly important because of the political and religious significance it holds. Not only does it have a great deal of religious significance, but it has a lot of political significance as well. Artifacts, temples, pyramids, and other structures display elite life and death in Upper Egypt throughout the centuries both prior to and post the unification of Egypt.Of the many sites in Egypt, this excavation is particularly important because it holds a lot of information about the Ancient Egyptians way of life and how they prepared themselves for death. By better interpreting their purposes for the things they did and the structures they built, it helps the research part of archaeology unearth, literally and figuratively, the meaning behind the subject they are studying. By looking at the temples of Karnak, archaeologists can determine the polytheistic beliefs and what God or Gods were worshiped in a particular temple. By examining the pyramids, archaeologists can determine what people were buried there- pharaohs, noblemen, priests, etc. By looking at Napata, archaeologists can determine what food the people ate here, what crops they grew, what activity was going on and what the town's purpose was politically and socially.  It was politics and trade primarily from what has been uncovered about it and furthermore the statues and obelisks show that this area is a site dedicated to the most important and successful as well as powerful elites in the history of Egypt. Different pharaohs are remembered through their defining statues, paintings, and other works of arts such as stories engraved in the structures and artifacts found for devotion to the gods they revered most. Other temples such as that of Ramses II and Seti I in Abydos are examples of sites analogous to this one in the sense that they were devotional and artistic, large, and today, heavily in ruins and in a region where towns were once heavily populated and used Even though Napata and Karnak were quite different politically from Abydos, they were just as significant and religion was just as important. In the case of Abydos, Osiris was a heavily revered and important god in their area where as in Karnak and Napata, Amun-Re, the chief go, was an influential deity in the area.
