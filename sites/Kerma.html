<h1>Kerma</h1>
<h3>Old Kingdom to New Kingdom</h3>

<h3>Itroduction</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Kerma is a Nubian City and capital Of the Kushite Kingdom. Kerma has within it many different sites that span a very long period of time. This site is an important one because of not only the presence of Egyptian artifacts, but because of the vast number of burials associate with Kerma. The link between Kerma and Egypt is an interesting one. Egyptian text mention the Kush, but do not mention anything about their culture. This lack of detail makes Kerma very interesting because we can learn more about this relatively elusive people. They were trade partners and sometimes military rivals with Egypt. Providing a lot of the raw materials such as animals, gold, and ebony that the Egyptians wanted. This relationship with Egypt gave way to a very prosperous time that allowed the area to expand. Occasionally the trade relationship between these different nations was disturbed by military attacks during times of "political upheaval".</p>
<p>The burials on the site are what are of a particular interest to most involved. While the main burial, inside of the mud-brick temples, have been heavily luted the discovery of hundreds of other burials, many undisturbed presented a vast amount of information, but how this information has been interpreted by archeologist differs. Many clearly Egyptian artifacts have caused slight confusion about Kerma, How the people lived, what their culture was like, and how close their ties to Egypt really were.   </p>

<h3>Geography</h3>
<hr>
<p>Kerma located in Northern Sudan, along the Nile Valley . The areas surrounding the site are rugged and very rocky. Kerma however, is a very fertile and wide plain. People were attracted to the site because of large mud-brick structures that were rising out of the ground. (1) The city is built around this mud-brick temple. Its location along the Nile made it an easy for the Egyptians to trade with, and also made it a very fertile area. Todays site is near to urban life, and is separated by a nice amount of trees from the neighboring population. </p>
