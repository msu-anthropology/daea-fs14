      <h1>Mis Island</h1>
      <h3>Medieval</h3>
	  <h4>Leah Auchter</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Mis Island lies on the Nile River within the Merowe Reservoir in the Sudan.  Occupation of this area occurred during the Medieval period.  The archaeological evidence reveals the island was inhabited by Christian people.  The beginnings of Christian in Egypt dates to 33 AD.  The rise of Christianity was not actively opposed by Egyptian religious institutions and so was able to spread and strengthen.  Egyptians welcomed Christianity as an alternative to Roman rule and taxation.  By 200AD  Alexandria had become an important center of Egyptian Christianity.  The dominant presence of Christianity, however, was short lived.  The 7th century invasion of Arabs brought Islam into Egypt where it became and has remained the majority religion.  Some Christian kingdoms to the south remained. Rock art, remnants of a church and its surrounding structures and the remains of 627 individuals from the cemeteries on Mis Island represent the focus of the excavations.  </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Introduction to Location and Geography</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p><img scr="http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/haaland332/images/figure3big.jpg"></p>
		 <p>Mis Island is located within the Nile’s fourth cataract.  The Fourth Cataract lies in the Monassir Desert.  After once attempting to navigate the cataract Winston Churchill reported the following about this portion of the Nile: "Throughout the whole length of the course of the Nile there is no more miserable wilderness than the Monassir Desert. The stream of the river is broken and its channel obstructed by a great confusion of boulders, between and among which the water rushes in dangerous cataracts. The sandy waste approaches the very brim, and only a few palm-trees, or here and there a squalid mud hamlet, reveal the existence of life."  The Fourth Nile Cataract is located in Northern Nubia.  </p>

		 <h3>Description of Site</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Mis Island lies on the Merowe Reservoir.  Dating to the Medieval period, the island represents the local center of the Christian faith.  The remains of a church and the substantial cemeteries attest to the island’s use (2).  The site includes four cemeteries, a church structure and the remnants of a settlement (1).  The cemeteries provide insight to the methods and styles of burials and the skeletal remains allow for an assessment of the lifestyle, especially the presence of violence, within the society. </p>

		 <h3>Description of Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>During the 2005 and 2006 seasons, the exhumations from 3 medieval cemeteries and a limited survey of the settlement was conducted.  In the 2007 fieldwork season, saw a continuation of the excavations of the three cemeteries and the settlement (1). </p>
		 <p>Cemetery 3-J-10: 44 individuals were exhumed in 2005-2006 and an additional 81 in the 2007 season.  The breakdown of ages showed a very high infant and child mortality rate tailing off during adolescence (1).  Two main burial practices were observed in this cemetery.  In the first, the deceased was placed on either side or on their back in the grave cut with no structural elaboration.  In the second style, the deceased was placed on their back and subsquare rocks were placed on either side of the head with a flat rock covering the face.  The first style appeared in a little over half of the graves that were excavated, while the rest demonstrated the second style of burial.  A few outliers showed unusual burials.  In at least one case, the deceased was aligned in the opposing direction (head at eastern end of grave cut) and in 2 burials the deceased were laid prone.  The monuments found at this cemetery were standard box-grave type.  They were constructed of subangular rocks set in a rectangle and with the rocks arranged to form flat external faces (1).  The interior was filled with smaller rocks and gravel.  Only the monuments of the infants and children differed.  Some were constructed of rocks forming irregular pavement while others were of small rocks forming an oval outline with gravel inside the perimeter.  Many of the children burials were unmarked likely due to erosion (1).  </p>
		 <p>Cemetery 3-J-11: During the 2005 and 2006 seasons, 163 graves were exhumed with an additional 120 in the 2007 season.  This cemetery demonstrated 4 burial styles.  The first involved the deceased placed on their back or on either side in a grave with no structural elaboration.  The second technique had the deceased placed on backs with either rocks or mud-bricks placed on either side of or over their head.  Thirdly, some of the deceased were placed on their backs and then large flat blocking stones were placed on ledges in the grave cut above the body.  The flat stones created a chamber in which earth was kept away from the body.  The final example involved an upper part of the grave cut in rectangular shape smaller than most graves and the lower part central to the upper portion and in of the same dimensions of the more standard grave cuts.  The deceased was placed within lower part and flat blocking stones were placed across the top of the lower part again creating a chamber (1).  The use of mud-bricks instead of stones were more common in this cemetery.  Again, the first style was the most common with the other three present only in small numbers (the fourth burial had only one example).  This cemetery displayed two types of monuments: a single example of four large mud-bricks placed in single line and the more common monument constructed of large, long stone slabs laid widthways forming a pavement over the grave.  A differentiating feature of this cemetery was the inclusion of ceramic vessels within the graves of a number of individuals.  The grave cuts were lengthened to allow space for the vessels.  The vessels were commonly cups or large spheres.</p>
		 <p>Church cemetery 3-J-18: A total of 219 exhumations came from this cemetery during the seasons 2005-2006 and 2007.  A significant observation was made in regards to the breakdown of age.  A differing pattern showed a much higher ratio of inhumations being of adults.  The reason for this is unlikely due to a drop in infant/children mortality and rather suggests a preference for burying deceased children in one of the other cemeteries on Mis Island.  Also this cemetery is associated with the church and therefore burials could have been reserved for more ‘prestigious’ individuals (1).  The monument types present here are different than the other cemeteries.  The monuments were constructed of either stone, fired brick, mud-brick or in just a few cases, a combination.  The fired-brick monuments were rectangular with natural sand/silt being the most common material used for the interior.  Remnants of lime rendering was present on a few of the perimeter bricks.  With the mud-brick monuments bricks were placed on end.  A line of bricks ran centrally along the length of the monument with bricks running off at right angles on either side (1).  The inhumations with stones protecting the head were present but in a greatly reduced number.  No graves in the church cemetery contained large blocking stones forming chambers.  One unique burial had the deceased placed within a grave cut and then half-way up the cut a capping was formed of fired-bricks and mud mortar.  This cemetery saw an overall improvement in the preservation of remains.  No ceramic vessels were found in any of the graves but jewelry in the form of beads, metal rings, earring and bracelets were found. </p>
		 <p>Cemetery 3-J-20: This last cemetery was positioned atop a hill.  There were only 5 inhumations all of which were clearly robbed (1).  A stone brick structure was built of carefully placed stones.  The walls were built directly onto the bedrock.  The prominent outcrops of bedrock were utilized as components of the walls.  The graves in this cemetery were cut directly into the bedrock (1).  The remnants of the monument was associated with the grave cut suggesting the structure may have been a mausoleum.  The position of the cemetery gives prominence to the graves occupying it suggesting that the individuals had a commanding position in their society.  </p>
		 <p>Along with the four cemeteries settlement 3-J-19 was excavated on a smaller scale.  Irregular stones were strewn over a large area with occasional depressions containing fewer stones.  These depressions signify the internal spaces of buildings (1).  Following the removal of the overburden subcircular and subsquare remains of building foundations constructed of stone were revealed.  A series of channels orientated in parallel lines north-south and east-west were presumably the result of small stakes being spaced very closely together creating fences or semi permanent walls.  Fourteen post holes, most of which were isolated, possible belonged to posts which supported ramshackle roofs over semipermanent animal pens.  The surface of the settlement had been baked by fire in places.  Since the areas were small, single fire events would likely the cause rather than cooking areas (1).  </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The excavations provided evidence of a Christian settlement in Medieval Nubia.  Christian period rock art was found on Mis Island.  Tracing some panels at site 3-J-56 revealed what appears to be a representation of a church.  There is a depiction of a person holding a cross staff in his right hand (2).  Various other types of crosses and monograms were also recorded.  The rock art at Mis Island mirrors the importance of the island as a local center for the Christian faith (2).  The rock art also demonstrated the separated symbolic spheres of the Fourth Nile Cataract (2).  The neighboring island of Ishashi contained no Christian rock art, only that of cattle and agriculture (which was completely absent from Mis Island) (3). </p>

		 <p>Studying the pathology of the human remains provides some insight to the lives of the people inhabiting Mis Island.  An in depth study was not conducted out in field.  A preliminary analysis revealed several instances of violence and possible violent damage to individuals.  At site 3-J-11 one individual sustained an unhealed trauma running across two of the lumbar vertebrae.  Another individual had sharp force trauma, probably a stabbing while another set of remains contained a skull with a large depression fracture that had healed.  Site 3-J-18 contained an individual who exhibited a healed depression fracture as well as fatal sharp-force trauma on the skull.  </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <p>Mis Island was a Medieval site containing four cemeteries, a settlement and the remnants of a church structure.  The area was the local center for the Christian faith.  The analysis of rock art from Mis Island and other neighboring places reveals distinct spheres of lifestyles.  Christian rock art is present only on Mis Island.  Depictions of cattle and agriculture is completely absent from Mis Island.  This evidence suggests that the Christian settlement relied on the adjacent settlements for crops and trade.  </p>
