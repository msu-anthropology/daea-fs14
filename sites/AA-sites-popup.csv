The excavation uncovered approximately four-fifths of the inner area of the fort (1).   Professor Vercoutter developed two theories as to the settlement at Semna South.  During the excavations no evidence of any Middle Kingdom building was found leading him to infer that the fort was used as camping ground of the men of the nearby forts or only occupied when a threat was present.  However, a scarab and offering table of the Middle Kingdom were later discovered, leading Vercoutter to consider the possibility that the fort contained a small Middle Kingdom settlement that was later completely destroyed by the Christian occupation.
