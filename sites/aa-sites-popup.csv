It is one of the few temples divided in half with one side in worship of a deity and the other parallel half being dedicated to another. Also found within the site were remnants of ancient caravan routes, New Kingdom blocks, and well preserved reliefs.

Kerma has within it many different sites that span a very long period of time. This site is an important one because of not only the presence of Egyptian artifacts, but because of the vast number of burials associate with Kerma. The link between Kerma and Egypt is an interesting one. Egyptian text mention the Kush, but do not mention anything about their culture. This lack of detail makes Kerma very interesting because we can learn more about this relatively elusive people. They were trade partners and sometimes military rivals with Egypt. Providing a lot of the raw materials such as animals, gold, and ebony that the Egyptians wanted. This relationship with Egypt gave way to a very prosperous time that allowed the area to expand. Occasionally the trade relationship between these different nations was disturbed by military attacks during times of "political upheaval".",<a href="Kerma.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
