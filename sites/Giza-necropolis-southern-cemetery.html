      <h1>Giza Necropolis Southern Cemetery</h1>
         <h3>Late Fourth Dynasty to Late Fifth Dynasty</h3>
<h4>By: Jason Lambracht</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Two main discoveries have been found near Heit el-Ghurab; The first is the lost city of the pyramid builders discussed elsewhere on this atlas, and the second is the cemetery of the pyramid builders located just north of the city and the Wall of the Crow.</p>
		 <p>Archaeologist Zahi Hawass had been looking for evidence of the pyramid worker’s cemetery when the site was discovered quite accidentally. On April 14, 1990, an American tourist was thrown from her horse as it tripped on a yet undiscovered mud-brick wall. This wall turned out to be part of a large tomb that after further excavation showed to be the resting place of the workers who built the late 4th dynasty pyramids (1).</p>
		 <p>Originally, each pyramid was thought to have taken 20 years to complete, and was built by over 100,000 slaves (1). The Greek historian Herodotus first recorded this when he visited Egypt in the 5th century B.C. While the nearby city shows the extensive support system that was used during the 67 or so years of pyramid construction including production facilities, housing, food and goods storage, building and craft facilities, and food production, the cemetery holds the secret to who the workers were, how they were treated, and combined with the city’s excavations, shows how many there were (1).</p>

		 <p>Located at the west edge of the current city of Nazlet-el-Samman, to the north of the western edge of the “Wall of the Crow” and north of the lost city of the pyramid builders lies the final resting place of its workers. While technically part of the Giza complex, and more particularly the Giza necropolis system, it stands on its own as being (1) quite isolated from the main complex (400 meters or so south of the pyramids), and (2) the only cemetery that is directly linked to the workers who built the pyramids rather than the elites that rest in the tombs and surrounding cemeteries themselves (1).</p>
		 <br>
	<h3>Site Description</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The accidental discovery of the mud brick wall eventually led to it being a part of the long, vaulted chamber portion of a tomb. Further excavation led to this being dubbed the upper cemetery as it takes its place on the top of a hill, which contains a total of 43 tombs. Additionally a lower cemetery was discovered that contains 30 overseer tombs and a large cemetery that was used to bury over 600 workers, and offers the most clues as to who the pyramid builders were. Although only 20% has been excavated, it has been dated from 2551 to 2323 B.C., from Khufu in the 4th Dynasty to the end of the 5th Dynasty (1).</p>

		 <h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Excavations have been taking place since its discovery in 1990 (2). The site can be broken into the Upper Cemetery composed of an elite status of overseers and their workers and a Lower Cemetery composed of laborers and their families (1)(4). These are further outlined below.</p>
		 <p>The Upper Cemetery</p>
		 <p>The first excavations uncovered a tomb with crude hieroglyphics that identified it as containing Ptah-shepsesu and his wife (1). This tomb contained two false doors that were used for the living to commune with and give offerings to the dead. At the far end of the chamber were the three burial shafts containing Ptah-shepsesu, his wife, and most probably, his son. The front of the chamber opened to a large, square courtyard composed of limestone. The composition of granite, diorite, limestone, and basalt that composed the tomb, closely matched the materials used in the pyramid construction and offered the first clue as to its association with that task. Attached to the tomb were additional burial shafts, which contained those that worked under Ptah-shepsesu (1).</p>
		 <p>Additionally 43 other tombs were found in this upper cemetery, all of which stem from a ramp that runs down a slope to the lower cemetery. These tombs are quite large compared to those in the lower cemetery and more elaborate as well. Most are built with limestone and mud brick, but many have rock-cut or stone facings. They also contain higher quality artifacts than in the lower tombs, and have superior inscriptions on their false doors and more painted areas. Like the lower cemetery, remains were found in burial shafts two to three feet underground, with many in wooden coffins. The inscriptions on the doors identified them as the final resting places of the “overseer of the side if the pyramid,” “director of workers,” “overseer of masonry,” and “inspector of the craftsman;” over 25 unique titles in all (1)(4). This indicates that the tombs indeed contain the final resting place of the elite class of pyramid builders and the chief overseers. Among the artisans’ tombs are Nefer-theith and his wife, which contains beautiful hieroglyphs with scenes of bread making, grain grinding, and beer making, as well as a list of feast days and offerings. This indicates that Nefer-theith could have been the overseer of the bakery in the city near Heit el-Ghurab. His inscription reads “one known by the king, weaver,” and additional hieroglyphs note 14 types of breads, and the processes of beer making, and bread making (1). Another indicator of the status of those contained in these tombs are curses inscribed upon the walls that state “As for any person, male or female, who shall do evil against this tomb and who shall enter therin, the crocodile shall be against him upon water, the hippopotamus shall be against him in the water, and the scorpion shall be against him on land” (2).</p>

		 </figure>
		 <p>The ramp leading from the lower cemetery to the upper one opens to a small limestone courtyard, and from its west wall extends a second ramp paved with mud and stone rubble with walls made of limestone and granite. Pottery sherds found here date this to the end of the 4th Dynasty and the beginning of the 5th dynasty. Mud sealings found here additionally date the upper cemetery to the 5th dynasty, showing that this cemetery was a few generations after pyramid construction took place. At the end of this ramp were two children’s graves and a mastaba tomb. Attached to the tomb was a room cut into the bedrock, which contained pottery along with a burial. A small niche in one of the walls contained four statues; a large one with two smaller ones to the right and one smaller one to the left. To the left of the one on the far left were the remains of a fifth statue made of wood and disintegrated by time. These statues contain inscriptions that identify them and the burial as the “overseer of the boat of the goddess Neith, the king’s acquaintance, Inty-shedu,” who was a carpenter who constructed boats for the king. All of the statues depict him at various ages in his life. These five statues correlate to the same practice used in most pyramid complexes from Khafre to the end of the Old Kingdom (1).</p>

		 <p>The Lower Cemetery</p>
		 <p>The 30 overseer tombs are incredibly varied. There are beehives, stepped domes, and gabled roofs. Typically two to six feet high, these roofs cover rectangular grave pits constructed much in the same way that the pyramids were, although much simpler. Some tombs also contain false doors, and courtyards, much like the tomb found in the upper cemetery. One tomb contains a ramp that goes up and around its dome that could resemble the ramp used during pyramid construction. The most remarkable tomb dubbed the “egg-dome,” was formed of mud brick and plastered with tafia into an egg shape. This shape Egyptologists feel is one that magically ensures resurrection, and is found in first dynasty tombs and the pyramids themselves. The false doors found in the tombs also describe its occupants including three wives of the pyramid builders who served as priestesses of Hathor, the goddess of music, dance, love, and the necropolis, who was the wife of Horus, the god of kings (1).</p>
		 <p>Small stone figurines were found among the tombs that depict the daily lives of the workers. One of which shows a woman with a black wig wearing a white robe covering all but her feet seated in a backless chair with her hands on her knees. Another shows her husband, and a third shows their servant kneeling and grinding grain. The physique and adornment of these figures clearly places them in the Old Kingdom. The woman has large eyes typical of the time period’s art, and the servant shows muscular arms showing the strength needed for her work. Among the figurines is a figure of a grinding stone adorned with red paint made to look like granite, and painted white in the middle to resemble flour. Similar statuettes found include potters, butchers, brewers, and bakers (1).</p>
		 <p>The main interest of the site is the remains of the 600 or so graves of the workers themselves found in the lower cemetery. Many of these graves contain bits of linen cloth stuck to the remains showing a symbolic mummification process (2). These graves also contain numerous artifacts including knives, pottery, jars of beer, bone and faience beads, and workers tools (1)(2). This sheds light on the importance that each of these people had; that they were given items to carry with them to the afterlife.</p>
		 <p>Overall</p>
		 <p>While none of the workers were found mummified, which would suggest nobility or royalty, the remains due show a certain level of care. There is an equal distribution of women and men, most between 40 and 45, with women between 30 and 35 due to problems in childbirth. The artisans and workers buried here show signs of heavy labor, and arthritis of the spinal column (1). Among the peasant worker graves, evidence shows a poor diet with multiple cases of anemia and very little evidence of meat (2). However, both simple and multiple fractures show that they had healed completely, and had good realignment of the bones, indicating the practice of splinting. There were successful amputations found, which kept the person alive for an additional 14 years, and no evidence to suggest that the majority of deaths occurred by anything more than a natural death (1) (4). All of the skeletal remains have been identified as Egyptian, with variances showing descent from all over Egypt (4) (5).</p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The notion of the pyramid builders as slaves began with Herodotus, and was popularized in the bible with Moses’ accounts and by Hollywood by Cecil B. de Mille. This discovery shows that the pyramid builders were contracted workers, were treated quite well in life and in death, and combined with discovery of the lost city of the pyramid builders, shows that they were revered in early Egyptian society (1). They were not just building the final resting place of their king; they were building a national project, something that would be part of Egypt forever. From the combined evidence of the two sites, we see that the builders worked in crews, called phyles, some as full time workers, others on a rotating schedule. In all there were roughly 20,000 to 30,000 workers and took only 80 years to build, each pyramid being fully completed before a new king began his rule (2). Often workers were divided into teams to help build comradery due to the harsh nature of the job (2). Overall there were 4,000 primary workers supported by 16,000 to 20,000 secondary workers (5).</p>
		 <p>With such hard lives, these workers, craftsman, artisans, and servants’ tombs show signs of one important trait - a life beyond this world (2). From the overseer’s tombs to the 600 or so worker’s graves, all evidence shows that they were designed to give them eternal life (2).</p>
		 <p>One great surprise the cemetery offered was the extent at which women participated in the pyramid’s construction. They were responsible for bread making, beer making, cooking, and household tasks in the nearby city. Numerous tombs showed overseers wives who held priestess duties, and even those of midwives. In all, women shared a comparable social ranking to men as evidenced by the artifacts found in their tombs and on their persons, as well as the inscriptions found throughout the complex (3). Additionally, 23% of the remains were children and babies showing the importance that the workers have their families present during their time of employment (5).</p>
